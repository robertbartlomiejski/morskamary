DATA_GOVERNANCE.txt

Scope
This file defines how data and documents in this repository are stored, transformed, cited, and quality controlled to support traceable and reproducible Blue Sociology research and micro-credential design.

Anchor excerpts that motivate these rules
Quote: follow the FAIR and CARE principles which provide high-level guidance on designing efficient and interlinked data systems
Source: Ocean Decade Brief Unesco.pdf page 10
Reasoning: Repository governance must implement traceable, interoperable data practices and an ethics-aware layer for community, local, and Indigenous knowledge.

Quote: FAIR principles aim to optimise the reuse of data by making it Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable
Source: Ocean Decade Brief Unesco.pdf page 10
Reasoning: Derived outputs must remain reusable through explicit provenance, open formats, and documented transformations.

Quote: This initiative emphasises co-design by prioritising the perspectives and observations of local communities to plan monitoring and research priorities
Source: Ocean Decade Brief Unesco.pdf page 9
Reasoning: Social-science datasets and qualitative materials should be governed as co-produced knowledge, not extractive data.

Repository data classes
Class A Raw sources
Definition: unmodified external publications and original datasets
Examples: EU and UN PDFs, institutional briefs, official datasets
Rule: never overwrite. Any correction must be stored as a new file in a derived or working area.

Class B Working files
Definition: interim analysis outputs, tables, cleaned copies used during active work
Rule: must include a provenance note in a companion text file that names parent sources and transformations.

Class C Derived datasets
Definition: outputs created by transforming Class A or Class B into new structured datasets
Examples: CSV matrices, merged spreadsheets, coded sector mappings
Rule: must be reproducible from parent sources and documented.

Class D Manuscripts and drafts
Definition: article drafts, micro-credential drafts, interpretive notes
Rule: treat as versioned working papers with change logs and explicit citation discipline.

Minimum metadata required for every derived dataset
a) Title of derived dataset
b) Creation date
c) Creator or maintainer
d) Parent source list with file names and versions
e) Transformation description sufficient to replicate
f) Data dictionary describing variables, units, categories, and missingness codes
g) Quality checks performed and outcomes
h) License and reuse constraints
i) Known limitations and intended use

FAIR alignment rules implemented in this repository
Findable
a) Use consistent file naming with date or version where applicable
b) Maintain an index file listing datasets and their purpose
c) Require a companion metadata file for every derived dataset

Accessible
a) Prefer open formats for derived outputs, such as CSV, with UTF-8 encoding
b) Ensure each dataset can be opened with common tools without proprietary dependencies when possible
c) Store documentation alongside data, not in external chat logs

Interoperable
a) Use ISO 8601 dates
b) Use consistent separators and decimal conventions per file
c) Use controlled vocabularies for sectors and competences with a published mapping table
d) Avoid ambiguous abbreviations unless defined in the data dictionary

Reusable
a) Preserve provenance chain from raw sources to derived outputs
b) Keep transformations deterministic where possible
c) Record assumptions and thresholds explicitly
d) Provide validation checks and expected ranges for key variables

CARE principles operationalisation in this repository
This repository follows CARE principles as referenced in the Ocean Decade Citizen Science Data Sharing Guidelines.

Rules for community, local, and Indigenous knowledge and qualitative social-science materials
a) Authority and consent
Do not publish sensitive qualitative data or community knowledge without documented consent and a clear sharing agreement.
b) Benefit and reciprocity
When compiling or analysing community-sourced materials, record the intended benefit and feedback pathway.
c) Responsibility
Document risks of harm, misrepresentation, or stigmatization for coastal and maritime communities.
d) Ethics
Store only what is necessary. Apply redaction and aggregation. If in doubt, do not publish the data.

Personal data and GDPR handling
a) Avoid storing directly identifying personal data in the public repository
b) If personal data is unavoidable for a specific research step, store it outside the public repository and keep only anonymised or aggregated outputs here
c) Maintain a de-identification note describing the method and residual re-identification risk
d) Never store private contact details, signatures, or financial identifiers in the public repository

Licensing and intellectual property
a) Treat every PDF and dataset as licensed by its original owner unless the license explicitly states otherwise
b) Do not redistribute restricted materials beyond what the license permits
c) For derived datasets, state the license you apply and confirm it is compatible with parent licenses
d) Do not copy large amounts of copyrighted text into derived datasets

Quality assurance for derived datasets
Required checks
a) Schema check with variable list and types
b) Missingness report
c) Duplicate detection for key identifiers
d) Range and domain checks for categorical variables
e) Reproduction check that rebuilding from parent sources yields the same result

Traceability rules
a) Every derived dataset must be linked to a specific commit hash
b) Every change must be recorded in CHANGELOG.txt
c) If a dataset is used in a manuscript figure or table, record the dataset version and commit in the manuscript notes

External contributions and review
a) All contributions must preserve provenance and metadata rules
b) Review focus is on reproducibility, citation integrity, and ethical compliance, not only on formatting
